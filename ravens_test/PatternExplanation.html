    <p>Introduction: You will complete a set of puzzles. On the screen, you will see a set of abstract
    pictures with one piece missing. Among a set of possible choices, you must select which one
    completes the pattern. For example, in the figure below, <b>choice 8</b> completes the pattern and
    would be the correct answer.</p>

    <table style="margin-top:2%; margin-bottom:2%">
        <tr>
            <td style="padding-right:1%"> <img class="image" src="{{ static 'ravens_test/Explanation_q.png' }}" style="width:100%;"/> </td>
            <td style="padding-left:3%"> <img class="image" src="{{ static 'ravens_test/Explanation_a.png' }}" style="width:100%;"/> </td>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <p>You will have 8 minutes to complete 12 such puzzles. A timer will be shown in the upper righthand corner as you complete the puzzles.
    </p>

    <p>Payment: After the 8 minutes allocated for this part, time will end. At the end of the experiment,
    the computer will randomly choose 2 puzzles from the 12. Each puzzle has the same chance of
    being chosen. For each of these two puzzles you solved correctly, you will earn 100LD.
