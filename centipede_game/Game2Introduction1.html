                <p>Once again, the game starts on REDâ€™s turn who has two choices shown by the red lines:
                CONTINUE or END. If RED continues, BLUE now has the same two choices illustrated by
                blue lines.</p>

                game endings. Between each turn of Game 1, the piles of money were first doubled. Then, the two
                piles were swapped. In Game 2, 100LD is removed from the smaller pile and 100LD is added to
                the larger pile. Then, the two piles are swapped. This is shown in the figure to the right.
