    <p>
    For this question, you are given a list of 6 lotteries with the prizes in Lab Dollars shown in the
    Table below. You will make a choice of which lottery to enter: 1-6. For each of the listed
    lotteries, the chance of winning the two payoffs is equal. That is, for lottery 2 for example, you
    can win 120LD with 50% chance and 180LD with 50% chance. At the end of the experiment, if
    the Lottery Choice is selected for payment, then the lottery # you selected will be run, and the
    randomly selected payoff given to you.
