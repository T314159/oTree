    Lastly, consider a game similar to the ones from earlier, where players alternate taking turns to STOP or CONTINUE:
    </p>
    <div style="float:top; width:50%;">
    <img class="image" src="{{ static 'IQ_and_rational_behavior_part3/image.png' }}" alt="test_image alt" style="width:100%;"/>
    </div>




    {{ formfield 'BI_choice' label="Given two purely logical computers are playing (meaning that will always maximize their money at any choice point and assume the other does the same), what turn will the game end?" }}
    <br>
    {{ next_button }}
